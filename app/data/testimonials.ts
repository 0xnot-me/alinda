    quote: "As an attorney looking to relocate to Palm Beach my lucky day was when I found Linda Olsson. She is the consummate intelligent pro who brought insights and strategy to every element of her plan to help us get the best value on the home we selected, the home of our dreams. Right off, her knowledge of the market fundamentals and its microtrends proved indispensable in weeding out properties during our selection process. And when I saw Linda step into the negotiating ring it became obvious that we were going to prevail on price. If I could give just one piece of advice it would be to call Linda now just to meet her and discover certain opportunities that you most likely wouldn’t know about.",

    quote: "If we could do 10 stars, we would! Linda knows the Palm Beach market very well – every nuance, every item that should be considered for real estate here, pricing, location. She is a wealth of information. She works tirelessly, is very professional, and has excellent communication skills. You’ll know what is happening with the home at all stages. She handled the sale of our family home in Palm Beach when my mother passed and my father decided to sell, providing excellent advice and guidance; strong service; comprehensive advertising; effective strategy… She is also very well connected with vendors in the community and was able to help us liquidate the home furnishings and household goods via recommendations, all of which ended up being 9 pickups and moves. Everyone involved was considerate and professional. If you want a quality realtor with proven knowledge and skills who understands the Palm Beach market well, you want Linda to be your realtor.",

    quote: "Linda was referred to us by a close friend when we first decided to move to Palm Beach in 2010. She found a perfect home for my wife and me in very short order and proceeded to help us purchase it with no hassle. She introduced us to the previous owner with whom we became good friends. Naturally when I decided to sell the house in 2023, I turned to Linda for help. She helped me establish the price (more than my expectations), which turned out to be very appropriate. Her knowledge of the real estate market in Palm Beach is outstanding. She marketed the house extensively through her website and through advertising with immediate results. Once the sales contract was signed she worked tirelessly to help us find firms to sell furniture, clothes and other items. I was downsizing into an independent living facility, which required selling most everything in a five bedroom house. It’s very hard to go through all of this with Linda and not end up becoming good friends.",

    quote: "We first went to Linda eight years ago when we wanted to relocate to Palm Beach. Linda’s work on our behalf resulted in our buying a great home in Palm Beach. We recently decided we wanted more room so the choice to call Linda again was automatic. This time she not only found us a great home, but sold our home in Palm Beach. Coordinating both the sale and finding a new property was a challenge, but Linda handled all aspects with speed, professionalism, and incredible dedication. Her know how in preparing our existing house for sale and the marketing of it was a testament to her knowledge of the local market and her vast experience in this market. Her take charge attitude and superior negotiating skills resulted in great outcomes at both ends of our transactions. I cannot recommend Linda and her people more enthusiastically. If you need a realtor to buy or sell your property you cannot miss with Linda.",

    quote: "I would highly recommend Linda Olsson, I interviewed many Palm Beach Brokers before selecting Linda. Her knowledge, sales record, and loyalty to her clients spoke for itself and that is why I chose her. Linda’s professionalism was exhibited early on in the selling process, she is detail driven, followed up on all leads, and never wasted my time. She was present at all showings, was timely, brought appropriate buyers for my home and shared feedback with me in order for us to learn how we could best market and sell the property. I was impressed by her local and national advertising, and her outstanding website. She was available 24/7 to answer all my questions and to hold my hand through the beginning of a national pandemic. Linda secured multiple bids when selling my Palm Beach home and her tireless work ethic secured a price close to my asking price. I would only use Linda for all my real estate needs. I was beyond thrilled.",

Linda took me under her wing and put up with my rants and perhaps, even a little stubbornness on occasion, and successfully sold my condo, within pennies of my asking price, but on the condition that I was out in January…. So then I had to find a new place quickly, at a difficult time of the year, in the market… And Linda met or exceeded all my expectations, all along the way. Nobody in the business is more motivated, or works any harder than Linda, or is more pleasant to work with, when selling or buying.",

    quote: "I came to Florida more than 2 years ago looking for a new home. Linda worked with me for more than a year and showed me many different properties from Jupiter to Palm Beach. I was a tough sell, a discriminating buyer that had a specific look and type of location in mind. I thought something near the ocean or on a golf course would be best. Linda worked tirelessly searching and screening the listings and we looked at too many to count over 12 months. Thanks to Linda I found my home and she was great in negotiating a fair price. I would say that there is no one that works longer hours, and works harder for her clients than Linda Olsson. She is very unusual and this was quite apparent when we were trying to schedule viewings. Other Brokers simply did not have the work ethic that Linda epitomizes. Thank you Linda!",

    quote: "After a few false starts with other brokers, we found your ad in the WSJ and decided that anybody who had the brains to advertise in that paper must have a lot of energy. We were right! You have boundless energy, and you went the extra mile in every way, patiently showing us every condominium for sale that fit our criteria in the town of PB and then WPB, then every house and condo that was available from Manalapan to Jupiter Island and then every house, lot and hovel available at the north end where we eventually bought what we decided would be a tear down. You found us our architect, our caretaker (your brother), the dog groomer, the dentist and the hairdresser. You negotiated every aspect of the closing, forcing the seller to remove her garbage from the property, which she had no intention of doing, and, once the place had been cleaned out, convinced us that it would be completely habitable with a fresh coat of paint. Why didn’t we think of that? Now, we can relax and see how we like life in the north end and work on our plans to build while living in our house, which may very well be just fine with some R&R. I think you helped find us one of the best deals in Palm Beach, and you and George worked together flawlessly. There was no pressure to buy. The only pressure was what you put on yourself to find what you thought would make us happy. It seemed that you had all the time in the world to spend finding the perfect thing, and I don’t know how you do it, but you do it better than any broker we’ve ever worked with. You were 100% there for us, and you still are after the closing. I have already referred several people I know to you with assurances that you are the “best broker in Palm Beach”.

Linda stuck with me for over a year, showing me condominiums in Palm Beach, Ft. Lauderdale, Boca Raton, Sunny Isles and Jupiter. Never getting frustrated, she continually sent me new listings, re-pricing of existing listings and new ideas. Knowing my wife and my likes and dislikes helped her get us information on the units she knew we might like, avoiding others, not wasting our time, for the sake of a sale. Finally in January 2009, she showed us the exact unit we were looking for. Right style, right location, right price and right community. She guided us through the settlement process and handled all the details. We settled in April 2009 and have enjoyed the apartment ever since.
