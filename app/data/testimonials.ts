    quote: "As an attorney looking to relocate to Palm Beach my lucky day was when I found Linda Olsson. She is the consummate intelligent pro who brought insights and strategy to every element of her plan to help us get the best value on the home we selected, the home of our dreams. Right off, her knowledge of the market fundamentals and its microtrends proved indispensable in weeding out properties during our selection process. And when I saw Linda step into the negotiating ring it became obvious that we were going to prevail on price. If I could give just one piece of advice it would be to call Linda now just to meet her and discover certain opportunities that you most likely wouldn't know about.",

    quote: "If we could do 10 stars, we would! Linda knows the Palm Beach market very well – every nuance, every item that should be considered for real estate here, pricing, location. She is a wealth of information. She works tirelessly, is very professional, and has excellent communication skills. You'll know what is happening with the home at all stages. She handled the sale of our family home in Palm Beach when my mother passed and my father decided to sell, providing excellent advice and guidance; strong service; comprehensive advertising; effective strategy… She is also very well connected with vendors in the community and was able to help us liquidate the home furnishings and household goods via recommendations, all of which ended up being 9 pickups and moves. Everyone involved was considerate and professional. If you want a quality realtor with proven knowledge and skills who understands the Palm Beach market well, you want Linda to be your realtor.",

    quote: "Linda was referred to us by a close friend when we first decided to move to Palm Beach in 2010. She found a perfect home for my wife and me in very short order and proceeded to help us purchase it with no hassle. She introduced us to the previous owner with whom we became good friends. Naturally when I decided to sell the house in 2023, I turned to Linda for help. She helped me establish the price (more than my expectations), which turned out to very appropriate. Her knowledge of the real estate market in Palm Beach is outstanding. She marketed the house extensively through her website and through advertising with immediate results.",

    quote: "We first went to Linda eight years ago when we wanted to relocate to Palm Beach. Linda's work on our behalf resulted in our buying a great home in Palm Beach. We recently decided we wanted more room so the choice to call Linda again was automatic. This time she not only found us a great home, but sold our home in Palm Beach. Coordinating both the sale and finding a new property was a challenge, but Linda handled all aspects with speed, professionalism, and incredible dedication.",

    quote: "I would highly recommend Linda Olsson, I interviewed many Palm Beach Brokers before selecting Linda. Her knowledge, sales record, and loyalty to her clients spoke for itself and that is why I chose her. Linda's professionalism was exhibited early on in the selling process, she is detail driven, followed up on all leads, and never wasted my time. She was present at all showings, was timely, brought appropriate buyers for my home and shared feedback with me in order for us to learn how we could best market and sell the property.",

    quote: "Linda is an extremely talented and experienced Palm Beach Realtor / Owner, who I could not recommend more highly. Linda took me under her wing and put up with my rants and perhaps, even a little stubbornness on occasion, and successfully sold my condo, within pennies of my asking price. Nobody in the business is more motivated, or works any harder than Linda, or is more pleasant to work with, when selling or buying.",
