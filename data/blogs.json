In some cases, those values didn’t recover for a decade. <strong>“The distinction is that when the recession hit, Palm Beach didn’t really react,” Jacks said. “Palm Beach (property values) didn’t stop growing,” she said. “Palm Beach continued to grow, but much slower. It didn’t crash.”</strong><strong> </strong> Read full article here…<a href=\"https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/20190917/palm-beach-homes-townrsquos-real-estate-values-have-longtime-staying-power-says-county-property-appraiser\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click to read full article here</a></p>\n<p><strong>We have Good News!  Palm Beach real estate is selling… we listed and put these properties under contract this month!</strong></p>\n<p>P.B.

But this July amped up the stakes. Compare the $347 million in single-family sales that closed in July to the same month of the previous three years: July 2018 saw 14 single-family transactions in Palm Beach totaling $109.36 million, according to courthouse records. In July 2017, that number was $81.49 million for 16 homes. And July 2016 saw a total of $64 million generated by 10 single-family sales.</p>\n<p>Analysts have to go back more than a year to find a month in which the official sales total even comes close to the one recorded last month. That would be April 2018 — at the height of the spring selling season — when documented transactions in town totaled about $249.4 million, with 25 single-family sales totaling $194 million and 41 condos adding another $55.4 million.</p>\n<p>The sales lull of last season had caught many Palm Beach agents and brokers off guard. They were stunned when transactions practically ground to a halt last fall after nine months of go-go action that began when Congress passed the federal tax overhaul in December 2017. The tax changes gave a substantial boost to business and industry while benefiting affluent Americans, thanks to changes to the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.</p>\n<p>The changes also capped the federal deduction for property, state and local taxes at $10,000. That sent a wave of affluent residents in high-tax states — including New York, New Jersey and California — to shop for a primary residence in Florida and, in particular, Palm Beach, <b><i>according to independent island broker Linda Olsson of Linda R.

In fact, 2019 broke real estate records and grabbed headlines.  In December, the record breaking sale of beauty mogul Sydell Miller’s oceanfront home at 1415 South Ocean Blvd. located in Area 3, Billionaires Row, to Steve Schonfeld and his wife was an amazing end to 2019.</p>\n<p><b>Just for the Record…let’s recap some of the biggest off market deals on the Island in 2019: </b><i> According to the Palm Beach Daily News article by, Darrel Hoffheinz, posted January 5, 2020;</i></p>\n<p><strong>1415 South Ocean Blvd.,</strong> Billionaire’s Row, sold in December; $105 million, reportedly actually sold for $111 million in an off market sale.</p>\n<p><b>1295 South Ocean Blvd.,</b> Billionaire’s Row, sold in June; $104.99 million.  Shattered a former island record for a single-buyer/single-seller transaction, which stood for more than a decade.</p>\n<p><b>60 Blossom Way</b>, Billionaire’s Row, sold in September; $99.13 million to Chicago hedge-funder, and part time Palm Beach resident, Ken Grifffin, who added to his adjacent holdings-now totaling more than 20 acres of mostly vacant acres.</p>\n<p><b>The list of sold Palm Beach homes goes on and on, and on…..just to name a few:</b></p>\n<p><strong>1960 South Ocean Blvd.,</strong> Billionaire’s Row; sold in August;  $43 million; Reported buyer, Steve Wynn/casino mogul.<br/>\n<strong>1071 North Ocean Blvd.,</strong> New Construction; sold in July; $40.87 million.<br/>\n<strong>525 North County Road,</strong> Vacant Oceanfront Lot; sold in July; $37.29; seller linked to Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovelv.<br/>\n<strong>101 Casa Bendita,</strong> Seaside Mansion, sold in July; $30,275; seller Robert V.

Trump’s move will bring huge Tax Advantages by claiming Mara-Lago in Palm Beach as his official residence and homestead he has traded a high tax state, New York, for a low one. <i> According to the Palm Beach Daily News by  Jeff Ostrowski.., Dated November 1, 2019;</i></p>\n<p>“<em>As Florida’s business boosters have stressed for decades, the state collects no income tax. In contrast, New York City residents can owe state and city income taxes at rates topping 12 percent. The 2017 tax package championed by Trump raised the burden on New Yorkers, and on residents of other high-tax states, by ending a longstanding federal tax deduction on state and local taxes.</em></p>\n<p><em>“There’s more of an incentive to come down here now, because you can’t deduct your state taxes,” said tax attorney Eugene Pollingue Jr. of Saul Ewing Arnstein and Lehr in West Palm Beach. “Every client I have, I recommend to them to become a Florida resident.”</em></p>\n<p><em>In another contrast with New York, Florida has no estate tax, which is imposed on the wealthy when they die. New York, on the other hand, has a top estate tax rate of 16 percent.</em></p>\n<p><em>Florida Tax Watch recently reported that residents of New York pay more in state and local taxes than residents of any other state. The group calculated New York’s annual tax burden at $11,810 per person. Florida ranked 40th, at $5,733.”</em></p>\n<p>Read this article to learn the benefits of declaring Florida your residence.

She handled the sale of our family home in Palm Beach when my mother passed and my father decided to sell, providing excellent advice and guidance; strong service; comprehensive advertising; effective strategy… She is also very well connected with vendors in the community and was able to help us liquidate the home furnishings and household goods via recommendations, all of which ended up being 9 pickups and moves.

With Buyers fleeing to Florida, Palm Beach has benefited from the highest level of net domestic migration – bringing with it an influx of wealthy entrepreneurs and retirees attracted by the tax climate, with no income or estate tax.</p>\n<p><b>According to Darryl Hoffheinz’s September 17, 2019 Article in the Palm Beach Daily News, Palm Beach County Property Appraiser Dorothy Jacks served up some history Monday <a href=\"https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/photogallery/LK/20190916/LIFESTYLE/916009991/PH/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">during a breakfast talk at The Breakers</a> that saw her emphasize how real estate values in the town of Palm Beach have for a century been eye-popping.</b> </p>\n<p>Palm Beach, she said, truly is a one-off. “Almost 400 properties on Palm Beach have an assessment greater than $10 million,” she said.  In the latest round of property valuations, the total market value assigned to about 9,500 individual “parcels” in town totaled $24.2 billion, she said. To further emphasize Palm Beach’s staying power, she pointed to the Great Recession, which gripped the county between 2007 and 2009 and caused real estate values nearly everywhere to plummet. In some cases, those values didn’t recover for a decade. “The distinction is that when the recession hit, Palm Beach didn’t really react,” Jacks said. “Palm Beach (property values) didn’t stop growing,” she said. “Palm Beach continued to grow, but much slower. It didn’t crash.”  Read full article here…<strong><a href=\"https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/20190917/palm-beach-homes-townrsquos-real-estate-values-have-longtime-staying-power-says-county-property-appraiser\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click to read full article</a></strong></p>\n<p><b>Have you been thinking about Buying a home in Palm Beach? We have some outstanding values available, at under $3 million…don’t miss your opportunity to Buy now.</b></p>\n<p><b>251 Park Avenue,</b> which is literally the least expensive property on the Island, in accordance with the Palm Beach MLS.  This home is situated on a very quiet, one way street that is truly up and coming.  There are new homes being built on the street, several have undergone renovations, and a few new homes completed over the past several years.  With 2,700 sq. ft. this wonderful 7 bedroom, 5 bath home is in great move in condition with hardwood floors and a fireplace.  This house is ripe for a renovation to suit your needs, and/or you may build your dream home in this excellent location next to a lovely park, within walking distance to the lake trail, beach, the Breakers, restaurants, Publix and houses ofWorship. Don’t drive?

The foyer opens to the dining room on the north, which is just adjacent to the kitchen and powder room. An area comprising the living room, library and stairway lies to the west of the foyer. Upstairs are a guest bedroom suite and the master suite, with its two bathrooms, dressing room, breakfast bar and closets.</p>\n<p>Doors are mirrored in the master suite, where the bathrooms are appointed in marble with walls finished in Venetian plaster. The main master bathroom has double vanities, and since the second bathroom is off of the dressing room, that space could be repurposed as an additional guest bedroom suite, Emmett says. The master bedroom opens to a balcony, with circular stairs leading down to the backyard and pool area.</p>\n<p>The area features a saltwater pool and a covered loggia with a barbecue grill and gas fireplace and a poolside pergola. Anchoring one end of the pool, the guest cottage is attached to the one-car garage. A porte-cochere leading to the garage provides covered parking on the west side of the house. Interior features include a gas-powered fireplace in the living room and built-in cabinetry in the library.</p>\n<p>Throughout are arched French doors and moldings, as well as the original Dade County pine floors, which Emmett had pulled up, sent away to be refinished and then reinstalled. The floors have been stenciled in the foyer, dining room, stair landing and upstairs hall.The kitchen is detailed with cream wood cabinetry, stainless-steel professional-grade appliances, a Jerusalem-stone floor, a butler’s pantry and marble countertops and backsplash.</p>\n<p>Read the full story here, as it’s owner recounts the painstaking renovation, and the love of the property, it’s location, and enjoyment the home provided them and their family over the years…<a href=\"https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/lifestyle/20191122/palm-beach-homes-emmett-house-was-envisioned-as-jewel-box-beach-home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Read Full Story</a></p>\n<div class=\"jp-relatedposts\" id=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div><!--<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"\n\t\t\txmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\n\t\t\txmlns:trackback=\"http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/\">\n\t\t<rdf:Description rdf:about=\"https://www.lindaolsson.com/palm-beach-homes/in-town-ocean-block-jewel-box-absolutely-stunning/\"\n    dc:identifier=\"https://www.lindaolsson.com/palm-beach-homes/in-town-ocean-block-jewel-box-absolutely-stunning/\"\n    dc:title=\"In-town Ocean Block &#8220;Jewel box&#8221;&#8230; Absolutely Stunning!\"\n    trackback:ping=\"https://www.lindaolsson.com/palm-beach-homes/in-town-ocean-block-jewel-box-absolutely-stunning/trackback/\" />\n</rdf:RDF>-->\n</div>",
